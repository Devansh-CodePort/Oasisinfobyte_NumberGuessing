# Number Guessing Game
The game generates a random number between 1 and 10. Players have 5 attempts to guess the correct number. After each guess, the program provides feedback, indicating if the guess is too high or too low. If the player guesses correctly within the allowed attempts, they win. Otherwise, the game reveals the correct number. The program uses basic Java concepts like loops, conditional statements, and random number generation to create an interactive and engaging guessing game experience.
