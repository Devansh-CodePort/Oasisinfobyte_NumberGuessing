# Number Guessing Game
This is a simple Number Guessing Game written in Java. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player needs to guess the number within a maximum of 10 attempts. The game keeps track of the player's score, which starts at 100 and decreases by 10 for each incorrect guess.
## Game Rules
1. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The player is prompted to enter their guess.
3. If the guess is correct, the program displays a congratulatory message and the number of attempts it took to guess the number correctly.
4. If the guess is incorrect, the program informs the player whether their guess was too high or too low, and their score is decreased by 10 points.
5. The game continues until the player guesses the number correctly or runs out of attempts (maximum 10 attempts).
6. After each game, the player is asked if they want to play again.
7. The game keeps track of the player's score throughout multiple rounds.
